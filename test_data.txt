Elden Ring felt like it's the culmination of all FromSoftware games that came before it. It's everything they learned from them and more. If you've played other FromSoftware games, you'll stumble upon a lot of familiar things, scenarios, locations, enemies, and they took all that and put it in a huge open world map.

The map itself is vague. If you like the “zero hands holding” approach, this is your game. Not only do you not know what to do next, but things are hard as they are in your average souls experience, you wander into the wrong neighborhood, and there goes all your runes.

This is the most polished experience from the series. It's visually beautiful and beautifully crafted, the world has much variety, some copy pasted landmarks but also lots of unique places with good interiors and architecture. I know some people complain that some enemies repeat, but even with that, there are tons of variety in this aspect as well.

Unlocked new fear of insects, centipedes, ants, fingers? They replaced spiders with fingers, and I don't know which is worse now...

I have mixed feelings about the gameplay. For most people, they nailed the combat in this one, and it's true, but there are some annoying things.

Unlike DS2, you can attack and dodge quite a lot before running out of stamina, which promotes faster gameplay, and that's usually what people seek and enjoy. To balance that, bosses also unleash a fury of successive fast attacks, and sometimes the window during which you can attack without being punished is really small, so the fight ends up with more downtime (defense time) than attacking, and that can be boring.

I'm not talking about op builds and cheeses, those exist, but I'm speaking of a normal first playthrough experience.

It feels like mobs don't have a stamina bar as u do. That was a nice feature from Nioh, being able to see the enemy's stamina bar.

Another issue is how huge bosses are, now it's not new, but man, it's becoming ridiculous. I know people loove to fight big bosses, but I use M&K because I like complete camera control, and even then, I don't even see all the boss. Some fights I don't see the hit because it's impossible to have all the boss within the camera frame, neither by locking the view nor by unlocking it.

Other than that, I absolutely love the animations, the weapon variety, the spell effects, the class variety, and mix and matching, all the new features are fun to play with.

On a more personal note, even though this game has everything, even things from previous souls games, more features, more work into it, I still think that experiencing similar features was more iconic in previous titles. If you're new to the genre, this game is a fantastic place to start. It has everything, and it's modern, but for me, I still find DS1 to be the most iconic and the most beautiful journey, but maybe cause I played it first, we will never know.
